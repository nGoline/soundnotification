# Privacy Policy for Sound Notification

## Effective Date: April 22, 2024

## Introduction

Sound Notification is designed to ensure you never miss important alerts by playing a chime for incoming notifications, even when your phone is in silent mode. This policy outlines our handling of any information processed by Sound Notification.

## Information Collection and Use

Sound Notification does not collect or store any personal information from users. The application requires access to your device's notifications solely to perform its primary function of playing a chime when notifications are received. Sound Notification does not read the content of notifications nor does it store or transmit any details about them.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

Since Sound Notification does not collect any personal information, no data is shared with or sold to third parties.

## Data Security

Sound Notification is committed to ensuring the security of its application. Although no personal data is collected, we continuously implement and update administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect the app from unauthorized access and use.

## Children's Privacy

Sound Notification is not specifically targeted at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We will let you know via in-app notification and/or email, and update the "Effective Date" at the top of this Privacy Policy.
